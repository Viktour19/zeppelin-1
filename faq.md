**What should I expect during the bootcamp?**  

The sessions would be a hands-on approach to learning machine learning and deep learning. We would not delve too deeply into theories even though we think it's equally important. We have 4 different speakers who are working hard to ensure participants understand and enjoy the sessions.

**What location is the bootcamp?**  

All sessions would be held at Carnegie Mellon University, Auditorium on the 5th floor of Telecom house, Kacyiru.

**Will we get certificates?**  

Yes, there will be certificates for successful participants - participants who see the bootcamp to the end.


**What happens after the bootcamp?**  

We would love to see you share your knowledge and also apply what you learn in your respective professions. We would also love to have you join the data science club and attend our weekly meetings.

**What time is the bootcamp?**  

The bootcamp is 6pm to 9pm every day of the bootcamp

**Can you share the event material and program**

Yes, we are working on a wiki that would contain all materials. The schedule can be found [here](http://aibootcamp.xyz/schedule)

**What should I bring along?**  

Please come along with your computer and charger

**Will this be annual?**  

Maybe, we are not sure yet. It could be more frequent than that.


**Can I learn primary skills**  

The bootcamp is geared towards people that already have good programming skills. AI is a complex field and it would be difficult to combine teaching primary skills with AI skills.


**What is expected from me as a participant**

Participants are expected to attend all sessions, complete all tasks given to them, collaborate with other participants and be nice during the bootcamp.
