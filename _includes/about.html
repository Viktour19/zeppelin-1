                    The rise of machines and systems that can act ‘intelligently’, perform tasks that have previously been attributed to humans alone such as writing poems, raising a child or driving a car is inevitable. At this heart of this revolutionary capabilities, is a discipline known as Artificial intelligence (AI). Several experts have claimed, with reason, that AI is a double-edged sword, with the potential to replace jobs, yet improve the fate of humanity. Bill gates recently named AI as one of the three fields to be in, to make an impact on the world. 
                    Good or bad, AI is here to stay and cannot be ignored. Gaining a grasp of this exciting area would give anyone an edge in the revolution. To this end, CMU-Africa Data science club is organizing a hands-on AI bootcamp for interested developers and residents in Kigali. The bootcamp would cover topics in Machine learning, deep learning and applications of AI in mobile computing as well as tools such as Scikit-learn, tensorflow, and Keras.
